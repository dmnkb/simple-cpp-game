# Tiny game written in C++ using OpenGL
I build this game to learn the basics of game development in C++. I aim to adhere to common best practices as I come to understand them. An imaginable goal could be a basic dungeon crawler leveraging simple 3d rendering and texturing.

This software is built on a MacBook but I plan to port it to Windows and upload it to common distribution platforms such as Steam.
