# Tiny game written in C++ using OpenGL
I'm building this game to learn game development in C++ sticking to best practices as I come to understand them. I'm not quite sure what the game might look like yet, as I'm constantly implementing new features based on current interests. I outline the scope of this project below:

### Roadmap
- [x] Project setup (CMake, GLFW, GLAD)
- [x] First person controller
- [x] Dear ImGUI
- [x] Lighting
    - [x] Blinn-Phong lighting model
    - [x] Dynamics amount of lights (using UBO)
    - [x] Spotlights
- [x] Refactor the renderer to become more generic (Introduce Mesh class)
- [x] Scene graph & scene nodes
- [x] Instanced rendering
- [ ] Render pass abstraction
- [ ] Shadow mapping
- [ ] Materials
- [ ] Basic deferred rendering
- [ ] Simple particle system OR grass rendering
- [ ] Integrate Assimp mesh loading
- [ ] Integrate Bullet Physics
- [ ] Rendering a heightmap from a texture
- [ ] Skeletal animation and GPU skinning
- [ ] Audio using [miniaudio](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio)
- [ ] UI using [clay](https://github.com/nicbarker/clay)
